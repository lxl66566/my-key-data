After an unexpected turn of events, Naru became the temporary manager of a girls’ dormitory. However, all the girls living there are magicians: shy daydreamer Konatsu, sharp-tongued ventriloquist Kuon, cool and vain Shizuru, and the ever-energetic moodmaker Teru.

With the magic academy’s principal Enis and genius magician Mikage in tow, his normal life gradually turns into one that is extraordinary. His bonds with the girls grow stronger, marked by many ecchi incidents that could only happen from living together.

This is a love story woven together by magic. Would you, too, like to live together with magic girls?
